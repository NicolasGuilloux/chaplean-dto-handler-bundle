The dto-handler-bundle loads the content of a request into a Data Transfer Object (DTO), mapping its properties such as entities from the database.
It uses the `ParamConverterInterface` provided by the [SensioLabs Framework Extra Bundle](https://symfony.com/doc/4.0/bundles/SensioFrameworkExtraBundle/index.html) to automatically map the request content to the appropriate variables.

## Quick Start

The dto-handler-bundle is simple to use as it requires almost no configuration. To use it in a controller, simply declare the variable in the controller's argument:

```php
public function postAction(DummyDataTransferObject $dto): Response
{
   // ...
}
```

And add the `DTO` annotation to your DTO:

```php
/**
 * @DTO
 */
final class DummyDataTransferObject
{
    // ...
}
```

## 1. Installation

This bundle required at least Symfony 3.4.

You can use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install dto-handler-bundle:
```bash
composer require chaplean/dto-handler-bundle
```

Then, enable the bundle by adding it to the list of registered bundles
in the `app/AppKernel.php` file of your project:

```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new Chaplean\Bundle\DtoHandlerBundle\ChapleanDtoHandlerBundle(),
        ];

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```


## 2. Getting started

- [Set up the Data Transfer Object](Doc/DataTransferObject.md)
- [Configure the ParamConverter](Doc/ParamConverter.md)

## 3. Example

In the following example, the data contained in the request will be loaded in the DTO. 

The `$property1` and the `$property2` will be not changed, so their values will be the one set in the request.

The `$property3` will be mapped to the appropriate entity using the field `keyname`, so the value of the `property3` field in the request should be a `keyname` of the DummyEntity.

The `$property4` will be an array of the entities mapped by `id`, so the `property4` value in the request should be an array of `id`.

Controller:

```php
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @ParamConverter(
 *     name="dtoVariable",
 *     converter="data_transfer_object_converter",
 *     options={"validations": "violationsList"}
 * )
 *
 * @param DummyDataTransferObject          $dummyDataTransferObject
 * @param ConstraintViolationListInterface $violationsList
 *
 * @return Response
 */
public function postAction(
    DummyDataTransferObject $dummyDataTransferObject,
    ConstraintViolationListInterface $violationsList
): Response {
    // ...
}
```

Data Transfer Object (DummyDataTransferObject):

```php
/**
 * Class DummyDataTransferObject.
 *
 * @DTO
 */
final class DummyDataTransferObject
{
    /**
     * @var string
     */
    public $property1;

    /**
     * @var integer
     *
     * @Assert\Type("integer")
     */
    public $property2;

    /**
     * @var DummyEntity
     *
     * @Assert\Type("Chaplean\Bundle\DtoHandlerBundle\Tests\Resources\Entity\DummyEntity")
     * @MapTo("keyname")
     */
    public $property3;

    /**
     * @var DummyEntity
     *
     * @Assert\All(
     *    @Assert\Type("Chaplean\Bundle\DtoHandlerBundle\Tests\Resources\Entity\DummyEntity")
     * )
     */
    public $property4;
}
```
